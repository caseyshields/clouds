# Pilot Instructor Webpage

Trying out some ideas for a static web page for my brother. I wanted to use [Yuan Chen's single div clouds](https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/f70a1f9435dc90197b253b26b4d69d42) for a nice visual gimmick. For the color scheme I was thinking of something based off atmospheric scattering during sunrise.

The clouds are inspired by this cool [article](https://css-tricks.com/drawing-realistic-clouds-with-svg-and-css/) by Beau Jackson. Probably inconsiderately processor intensive for visitors, but still cool. https://www.nephele.cloud/

The neat 3d text was from Sarah Fossheim's [article](https://css-tricks.com/creating-playful-effects-with-css-text-shadows/).

[Curved text](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/curved-text-along-path/)
